Speaker 0    00:00    How do you spend your days now? Like what, what do you allocate most of your time to? My time is mostly split, uh, what's between SpaceX and Tesla. And of course I try to spend, um, a part of every week at open AI. Um, so I spend most, I spend basically half a day at OpenAI most weeks. Um, and then, and then I have some open air stuff that happens during the week. But other than that, it's really basic. When Tesla, Tesla, like what is your time look like there? Uh, yeah, so that's a good question. Um, I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or, or on business things. But actually almost, uh, almost all my time, like 80% of it is spent on engineering, design and engineering and design. So it's, um, developing next generation product at that's 80% of it.  
Speaker 0    00:55    Um, you probably don't remember this a very long time ago, many, many years. You took me on a tour of space X, and the most impressive thing was that you knew every detail of the rocket and every piece of engineering that went into it. I don't think many people get that about you. Yeah, I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something. I just find like business is fine, but, um, like I, uh, but really it's, you know, it was like, it's face sex. Uh, Gwen Shotwell is chief operating officer. She kinda manages, um, uh, legal finance, um, sales, um, and it kind of general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team working on improving the Falcon nine and the dragon spacecraft and developing the most colonial architecture. Um, and then at Tesla it's working on the model three. And, uh, you know, some in the design studio should a yet, um, half a day a week, um, dealing with aesthetics and, and, uh, look and feel things. And, and then most of us week is just going through engineering of the car itself, as well as the engineering of the factory.
